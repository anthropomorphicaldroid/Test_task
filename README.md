Task: Logic, Algorithms and Mathematics  
- Create an editor script (to also work in editor mode without pressing the “Play” button) which allows 
finding duplicates in an endless list (string[] array) of string-inputs (e.g., sentences). It is up to you how 
you  do  this,  but  of  course  it  is  best  if  we  do  not  have  many  false  alarms,  but  also  no/less  missed 
hits/duplicates. Not only sentences/strings that are exactly similar are duplicates(!), but all strings that 
are similar enough regarding their message/content. For this, best to have different settings to decide 
about how tolerant the algorithm is and more than 1 criteria for your comparability check. 
- For  our  assessment,  it  is  important  that  even  when  comparing  many  hundreds  or  thousands  of 
sentences with each other, the performance is good and that duplicates are found as reliably as possible 
even if they are not word-for-word identical. 
- Optional for junior developers, mandatory for middle or senior developers (some extra work): Make an 
import  and  export  from  XML  files  to  import  sentences  (strings),  then  find  and  delete  duplicates  and 
save  the  cleaned  list  back  to  XML.  This  process  should  be  done  in  a  way  that  demonstrates  your 
understanding of the needs of users, i.e., your solution should make sense in practice and save the user 
a lot of time and give all necessary possibilities (e.g., to manually check the filtering).
